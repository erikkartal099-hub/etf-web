## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security@coindesketf.example.com with:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)
3. Allow up to 48 hours for initial response
4. Work with us to verify and fix the issue

We appreciate responsible disclosure and will acknowledge security researchers who report valid vulnerabilities.

## Security Best Practices for Deployment

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files
- Use different keys for dev/staging/prod
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use Vercel/Supabase secrets management

### Database
- Enable RLS on all tables
- Use service role key only in Edge Functions
- Regular backups (automated via Supabase)
- Monitor for suspicious queries

### Frontend
- Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- CORS configuration
- Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN assets
- Regular dependency updates

### API Security
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user-generated content
- Rate limit all endpoints
- Log suspicious activities

### Smart Contracts (if deployed)
- Professional security audit before mainnet
- Use established patterns (OpenZeppelin)
- Multi-sig wallets for admin functions
- Testnet testing before production

## Compliance Considerations

This platform may require compliance with:
- KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations
- AML (Anti-Money Laundering) laws
